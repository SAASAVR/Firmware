The SAAS system contains three main components (Hardware, firmware, software). This repository focuses on the firmware component.
Within the firmware, there are two sub-systems.
- Arduino sketch (C++)
- Client (Python 3.8.10 on an Ubuntu 16.4 OS)
## Requirements
Ensure that the operating system being used is Ubuntu 16.4. If the lattepanda does not currently has Ubuntu installed please [refer to the OS installation instructions.](https://docs.lattepanda.com/content/1st_edition/os/)
Ensure that python 3.8.10 is installed before running scripts
